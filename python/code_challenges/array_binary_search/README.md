Write a function called `BinarySearch` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key

-   return:
    -   the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key
    -   or -1 if the element is not in the array

## Approach & Efficiency

**Big O**

-   Time: O(log n)
-   Space: O(1)
